# tictactoe
A two-player game of tic tac toe using a PyQt5 GUI.

If you want to run the code yourself without the executable I would suggest setting up a virtual environment and then pip installing the requirements file:  
<ol>
<li>python -m virtualenv venv                        #Creates virtual environment named venv</li>
<li>venv\Scripts\activate       #Activates the new virtual environment</li>
<li>pip install -r tictactoe_requirements.txt     #pip install the requirements file</li>
</ol>
